# DesignPatterns

###Prototype Design pattern
This is a creational design pattern, which provides guidance on best way to create prototype or clone of an existing object.
There are two ways an object can be clones - Shallow and Deep
In Shallow Copy any object types fields in the original object can be refferd to in the clone copy.
In Deep Copy any object types fields in the original object will be explicitly created a new and then assigned to the clone. Hence clone will hae its own copy of object type fields.
