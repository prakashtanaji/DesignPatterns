git config user.name prakashtanaji@hotmail.com
git config --local --list

This will list all the local repo options mainly the login user name to SHOW as the checking in user
The login credentials prompt might taka any valid user credential, but setting the user.name and user.email will be used to show in the git as the checked in user

git config user.name xyz@xyz.com

git config user.email xyz.xyz.com

Now you may be prompted for the login credentail to push the changes and it can be any valid user, may be abc@abc.com(in order to force the prompt and not make git use stored credetials from global config cache, you need to set the "git credential.helper "" " this will remove any creds from cache and force to enter creds)

Once done the code will be successfully pushed but will show up the checkedin user as user.email. Note, the the user email and name at the time of commit will be picked. Also the user.name is the login who committed the code and also also authored the code in case email and name dont match. Make sure the user.name and email matched the login user name to map to the git hub profile of the user who is checking in the code. Include @xyz.com if the user name has that suffix.
